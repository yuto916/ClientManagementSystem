# Client Management System

## Description
This is a simple client management system with a database.
There are two types of users, which are administrator and salesperson. 

Administrators can
- create a new salesperson,
- create a new client,
- change their password,
- can see the list of all salespeople,
- can see the list of all clients.

<br/>

Salespeople can
- create a new client,
- create a new call record,
- change their password,
- can see the list of clients associated with the salesperson currently logged in,
- can see the list of calls made with clients who are associated with the salesperson currently logged in. 

<br/>

NOTE: When a new client is created when the user is an administrator, a salesperson must be selected <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the drop-down menu who will be associated with the client. If a new client is created when <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user is a salesperson, the client will be associated with the salesperson who is logged in.<br/>
